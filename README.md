To get this bot running, you will need to obtain your own Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID.

1. Obtain a Telegram Bot Token
Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.

Send the /newbot command and follow the instructions to name your bot.

Once created, BotFather will provide an API Token. It looks like this: 123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTuvWxYz.

Keep this token secret! Do not share it publicly.

2. Find your Chat ID
Search for @userinfobot on Telegram.

Send any message to it, and it will reply with your unique Id (a string of numbers).

Copy this ID; the bot will use it to know where to send the price alerts.

3. Configure the Bot
Open eth_bot.py and replace the placeholders with your actual credentials
